# Figma Edit MCP

Connect AI coding assistants to Figma via Model Context Protocol. Read designs, create and modify elements, manage components, variables, and styles — all programmatically through your AI assistant.

**Supported AI Integrations:**
- Cursor
- GitHub Copilot (VS Code)
- Google Antigravity
- Claude Code (VS Code & CLI)
- Claude Desktop

## Project Structure

- `src/mcp_server/` — TypeScript MCP server implementing 40+ Figma tools
- `src/figma_plugin/` — Figma plugin with a modular handler architecture
- `src/socket.ts` — WebSocket server that bridges communication between the MCP server and the Figma plugin

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Bun
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

### 2. Setup (Install & Build)

```bash
bun setup
```

This installs dependencies and builds both the MCP server and the Figma plugin.

### 3. Configure Integration

```bash
bun integrate
```

You'll see an interactive menu:

```
🤖 Figma Edit MCP Integration
========================================

Select an integration to configure:

  1) Google Antigravity
  2) Visual Studio Code (GitHub Copilot)
  3) Cursor
  4) Claude Desktop
  5) Claude Code (Command Line, Visual Studio Code, Google Antigravity)

  q) Quit

Enter your choice:
```

### 4. Start WebSocket Server

```bash
bun socket
```

Keep this terminal running. The WebSocket server bridges communication between your AI assistant and the Figma plugin.

### 5. Install Figma Plugin

Install from [install locally](#figma-plugin-local-install)

---

## Integration-Specific Setup

Run `bun integrate` and select the appropriate option:

### Google Antigravity

Select option `1`. Configuration is created at `~/.gemini/antigravity/mcp_config.json`. Restart Antigravity to load the MCP server — tools are then automatically available.

### VS Code / GitHub Copilot

1. Requires VS Code 1.102+ with Copilot
2. Enable Agent Mode in Copilot settings
3. Select option `2` (creates `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/mcp.json`)
4. Use `@workspace` or agent mode to access MCP tools

### Cursor

Select option `3`. Configuration is created at `~/.cursor/mcp.json`.

### Claude Desktop

Select option `4`. Configuration is created at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`.

### Claude Code (VS Code & CLI)

Select option `5` to see the CLI command, then run it in your terminal:

```bash
claude mcp add FigmaEdit bun run /path/to/figma-edit-mcp/dist/server.js
```

Replace `/path/to/figma-edit-mcp` with your actual installation path.

---

## Manual Configuration

If you prefer manual setup, add the following to your MCP config file:

| Integration | Config File Location |
|---|---|
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` |
| VS Code / Copilot | `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/mcp.json` |
| Antigravity | `~/.gemini/antigravity/mcp_config.json` |
| Claude Desktop | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "FigmaEdit": {
      "command": "bun",
      "args": ["run", "/path/to/figma-edit-mcp/dist/server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Development Setup

### Building from Source

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Build the MCP server
bun run build

# Watch mode for development
bun run dev

# Build both MCP server and Figma plugin
bun run build:all
```

### WebSocket Server

Start the WebSocket server (required for Figma plugin communication):

```bash
bun socket
```

### Figma Plugin (Local Install)

1. In Figma, go to Plugins > Development > New Plugin
2. Choose "Link existing plugin"
3. Select the `src/figma_plugin/manifest.json` file
4. The plugin should now be available in your Figma development plugins

---

## Windows + WSL Guide

1. Install Bun via PowerShell

```bash
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1|iex"
```

2. Uncomment the hostname `0.0.0.0` in `src/socket.ts`

```typescript
// uncomment this to allow connections in windows wsl
hostname: "0.0.0.0",
```

3. Start the WebSocket server

```bash
bun socket
```

---

## Usage

1. Start the WebSocket server (`bun socket`)
2. Install the MCP server in your AI coding assistant (`bun integrate`)
3. Open Figma and run the Figma Edit MCP Plugin
4. Join a channel using the `join_channel` tool to establish communication
5. Use your AI assistant to interact with Figma via the available MCP tools

## Hallucination Safeguards

This fork adds multiple layers of protection against AI hallucination damage. These safeguards are enforced inside the Figma plugin at execution time and cannot be bypassed by the MCP server or the AI agent.

### Scope Restriction

Editable scope is locked when the plugin connects.  
If you paste a HTTP link to a specific Page/Layer, your AI assistant or agent will only be able to make changes to that Page/Layer or its child layers.  
If you do **NOT** provide a HTTP link to a specific Page/Layer, your AI assistant or agent will **NOT** be able to make any changes to the designs in the current Figma file.    
Every write operation is checked against this scope before it runs — anything outside the locked scope is denied outright.

| Mode | Effect |
|---|---|
| Link provided | Writes allowed only within that node and its descendants |
| No link (default) | All writes denied; reads always permitted |

### Node Name Verification

Every write tool requires the AI to supply the expected name of the target node (`nodeName`), or the parent node (`parentNodeName` for creation tools).  
The plugin resolves the actual name by ID and compares it before executing. A mismatch is rejected with an error that directs the agent to refresh its context.

This catches the most common hallucination failure mode: an AI confidently operating on a stale or fabricated node ID that no longer points to the intended target.

| Parameter | Used by |
|---|---|
| `nodeName` | All single-node modification tools (17 tools) |
| `parentNodeName` | All creation tools (4 tools) |
| Per-item `nodeName` | All multi-node batch tools (6 tools) |

## Best Practices

When working with Figma Edit MCP:

1. Always join a channel first with `join_channel` before sending any other commands

---

## Notes
### Automatic Node ID Normalization

Node IDs copied from Figma URLs use dashes (`20485-41`), but the plugin API expects colons (`20485:41`).  The MCP server automatically converts dash-format IDs before forwarding, so either format works without manual intervention.
