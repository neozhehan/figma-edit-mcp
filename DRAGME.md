## 🎯 Objective

Install and configure Figma Edit MCP with **AI-agent-friendly decision trees** and fail-safe checkpoints at each step. This guide covers cloning the repository, installing dependencies, configuring MCP for your AI coding assistant, and connecting the Figma plugin.

### 🤖 For AI Agents Reading This Guide

This guide is **specifically designed for AI agents** to understand, parse, and execute setup instructions autonomously. Each section includes:

- **Clear boolean decision points** for branching logic
- **Explicit command verification steps** with expected outputs
- **Fallback strategies** when primary methods fail
- **Environment-specific instructions** based on system capabilities
- **Checkpoint validations** before proceeding to next steps

**AI Agent Instructions**:
1. Execute each command and verify the expected output
2. Follow the branching logic based on system environment
3. If any step fails, use the provided fallback methods
4. Always validate checkpoints before continuing
5. **CRITICAL**: Create and update visual progress tracking using Mermaid diagrams at each major checkpoint

## 🛡️ Hallucination Safeguards — Rules for AI Agents

**Read this section before executing any Figma commands.**  
These are hard constraints enforced by the plugin at execution time. They exist specifically to prevent AI agents from damaging designs through hallucinated or stale node references. Violating them will result in denied operations — the plugin will not execute the command.

### 1. Scope is locked at connection time

The user sets an editable scope when the Figma plugin connects. You cannot modify anything outside that scope, and you cannot change or extend the scope programmatically.

- If the user connected **without** a HTTP link to a Figma Page/Layer, the entire session is **read-only**. No write commands will succeed.
- If the user connected **with** a HTTP link to a Figma Page/Layer, writes are permitted only within that node and its child nodes.
  
  **Example:**
  - User connects with `https://www.figma.com/design/12345/My-File?node-id=100-200`
  - The editable scope is now the node with ID `100:200` and all its child nodes
  - You can modify nodes within this scope, but not nodes outside it
  - You cannot change or extend the scope programmatically  
  
<br>
  
To get a HTTP Link to a Figma **Page**, your user will have to follow the following steps:
1. In Figma Desktop App, open the Figma file
2. Right click on the page name in the Pages section on the left sidebar
3. Click on "Copy link to page"
4. Paste the link in the Link to Selection field in the Figma Edit MCP plugin  
  
<br>

To get a HTTP Link to a Figma **Layer**, your user will have to follow the following steps:
1. In Figma Desktop App, open the Figma file
2. Right click on the Layer name in the Layers section on the left sidebar
3. Click on "Copy/Paste as" -> "Copy link to selection"
4. Paste the link in the Link to Selection field in the Figma Edit MCP plugin  

<br>
  
**Error Response guide:**

| Error received | What it means | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `READ_ONLY_MODE` | Session is read-only | Inform the user. Only read commands are available. |
| `OUTSIDE_SCOPE` | Target node is outside the locked scope | Do not retry with the same ID. Inform the user. |
| `PARENT_OUTSIDE_SCOPE` | Creation target parent is outside scope | The parent you specified is not in the editable tree. |
| `CLONING_SOURCE_NODE_OUTSIDE_SCOPE` | Cloning source node is outside editable scope | Do not retry with the same ID. Inform the user. |

### 2. Every write command requires name verification

All modification tools require a `nodeName` parameter. All creation tools require a `parentNodeName` parameter. Multi-node batch tools require a name on each individual item in the array. The plugin looks up the real name by ID and rejects the operation if it does not match.

**How to get the correct name:**  
Read the node first via `get_nodes_info` or `get_document_info`. Use the `name` field from the response verbatim. Do not guess, abbreviate, or fabricate node names.

**Name x ID Mismatch Response Guide:**

| Error received | What it means | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `NAME_MISMATCH` | `nodeName` does not match the actual name of `nodeId` | Your context is stale or the ID is wrong. Call `get_nodes_info` to refresh, then retry with the correct ID and name. |
| `PARENT_NAME_MISMATCH` | `parentNodeName` does not match the actual name of `parentId` | Same as above — refresh context before retrying. |

### 3. Do not assume anything about selection state

There are no tools that read or act on "current selection." All tools require explicit node IDs. Never assume you know which node is selected in Figma — always discover nodes through `get_document_info` or `get_nodes_info`.

### 4. Node IDs from Figma URLs work as-is

Figma URLs contain node IDs with dashes (e.g., `20485-41`). The MCP server converts these to colon format (`20485:41`) automatically before forwarding to the plugin. Pass URL-format IDs through unchanged.

### 5. Batch tools verify every item individually

Tools like `delete_multiple_nodes`, `set_multiple_text_contents`, `set_multiple_annotations`, and `set_instance_overrides` run scope and name checks on each item in the array. A single invalid item fails the entire operation. Validate each item's ID and name before calling.

## 📋 System Environment Detection

**CRITICAL FOR AI AGENTS**: Execute these detection commands and use results for branching decisions.

```bash
# System Detection Commands - Execute ALL and store results
echo "=== SYSTEM ENVIRONMENT DETECTION ==="

# 1. Operating System Check
OS_TYPE=$(uname -s)
echo "OS_TYPE: $OS_TYPE"

# 2. Shell Type Detection
echo "SHELL_TYPE: $SHELL"

# 3. Homebrew Availability
HOMEBREW_AVAILABLE=$(which brew >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "YES" || echo "NO")
echo "HOMEBREW_AVAILABLE: $HOMEBREW_AVAILABLE"

# 4. Node.js Availability
NODE_AVAILABLE=$(which node >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "YES" || echo "NO")
if [ "$NODE_AVAILABLE" = "YES" ]; then
    NODE_VERSION=$(node --version 2>/dev/null || echo "UNKNOWN")
    echo "NODE_VERSION: $NODE_VERSION"
fi

# 5. Bun Availability
BUN_AVAILABLE=$(which bun >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "YES" || echo "NO")
if [ "$BUN_AVAILABLE" = "YES" ]; then
    BUN_VERSION=$(bun --version 2>/dev/null || echo "UNKNOWN")
    echo "BUN_VERSION: $BUN_VERSION"
fi

# 6. Git Availability
GIT_AVAILABLE=$(which git >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "YES" || echo "NO")
if [ "$GIT_AVAILABLE" = "YES" ]; then
    GIT_VERSION=$(git --version 2>/dev/null || echo "UNKNOWN")
    echo "GIT_VERSION: $GIT_VERSION"
fi

# 7. Admin/Sudo Access Check
SUDO_AVAILABLE=$(sudo -n true 2>/dev/null && echo "YES" || echo "NO")
echo "SUDO_AVAILABLE: $SUDO_AVAILABLE"

echo "=== DETECTION COMPLETE ==="
```

## 📊 AI Agent Progress Tracking Templates

### 🛠️ Method-Specific Progress Templates

#### For Method A (Full Installation):
```mermaid
graph LR
    A1[🍺 Homebrew Check] --> A2[📦 Install Dependencies]
    A2 --> A3[⚙️ MCP Setup]
    A3 --> A4[✅ Ready for WebSocket]
```

#### For Method B (Minimal Setup):
```mermaid
graph LR
    B1[🖥️ Project Cloned] --> B2[📖 Setup Dependencies]
    B2 --> B3[⚙️ MCP Setup]
    B3 --> B4[✅ Ready for WebSocket]
```

### 📍 Mandatory Progress Update Points

**AI Agents MUST update progress diagram at these checkpoints:**

1. **After Environment Detection** (Step 1)
2. **After Method Selection** (Step 2)
3. **After Dependency Installation** (Step 3)
4. **After MCP Setup and Configuration** (Step 4)
5. **After WebSocket Start** (Step 5)
6. **After Figma Plugin Install** (Step 6)
7. **After Integration Test** (Step 7)
8. **Final Completion** (Step 8)

### 🤖 AI Agent Progress Update Commands

**Use these exact commands at each checkpoint:**

```
CHECKPOINT [STEP_NUMBER]: [STEP_NAME]

Please create/update the progress tracking diagram to show:
- Current step: [STEP_NAME]
- Status: [✅ COMPLETED / 🔄 CURRENT / ❌ FAILED]
- Next step: [NEXT_STEP_NAME]
- Any warnings or issues encountered

Update the Mermaid diagram with appropriate class assignments and show the overall progress percentage.
```

### 🤖 AI Agent Decision Logic

Based on the detection results above, AI agents should follow this decision tree:

```bash
# AI Agent Decision Variables (set based on detection above)
HOMEBREW_AVAILABLE="YES"  # or "NO"
NODE_AVAILABLE="YES"      # or "NO"
BUN_AVAILABLE="YES"       # or "NO"
GIT_AVAILABLE="YES"       # or "NO"
SUDO_AVAILABLE="YES"      # or "NO"
```

**Decision Tree**:
- IF `HOMEBREW_AVAILABLE="YES"` AND `SUDO_AVAILABLE="YES"` → **Method A1: Homebrew Installation**
- ELIF `SUDO_AVAILABLE="YES"` AND `HOMEBREW_AVAILABLE="NO"` → **Method A2: Direct Installation**
- ELIF `GIT_AVAILABLE="YES"` AND `SUDO_AVAILABLE="NO"` → **Method B: Minimal Setup**
- ELSE → **Error: Insufficient System Access**

## 🛡️ Method Selection Based on Environment

### 🌟 Method A1: Homebrew Installation (Recommended)
**Conditions**: `HOMEBREW_AVAILABLE="YES"` AND `SUDO_AVAILABLE="YES"`
- Uses Homebrew package manager
- Cleanest dependency management
- Best for macOS systems with Homebrew

### 🔧 Method A2: Direct Installation
**Conditions**: `SUDO_AVAILABLE="YES"` AND `HOMEBREW_AVAILABLE="NO"`
- Direct installation without package manager
- For systems without Homebrew but with admin access
- Manual dependency management

### 📱 Method B: Minimal Setup
**Conditions**: `GIT_AVAILABLE="YES"` AND `SUDO_AVAILABLE="NO"`
- No system-wide installations required
- Assumes Bun is already available or can be installed without admin
- For restricted environments

```

**Continue to Common Steps below.**

---

## 🔗 Common Steps (All Methods)

### Step C.1: Verify MCP Configuration

**🚨 CRITICAL FOR AI AGENTS**: Verify the project is properly built and the MCP configuration exists.

```bash
# Verify current directory
pwd | grep "figma-edit-mcp" && echo "✅ Correct directory" || echo "❌ ERROR: Wrong directory"

# Verify project structure
ls package.json src && echo "✅ Project structure valid" || echo "❌ ERROR: Invalid project structure"

# Verify the dist output exists
test -f dist/server.js && echo "✅ MCP server built" || echo "❌ ERROR: Run 'bun run build' first"

# Run integrate if not already done
echo "💡 If you haven't run 'bun integrate' yet, do so now to configure your AI assistant."
```

**CHECKPOINT C.1**: Verify in your AI coding assistant's settings that "FigmaEdit" shows as connected. For Cursor, open Settings (`Cmd+,` on Mac, `Ctrl+,` on Windows/Linux) and search "MCP".

**AI AGENTS**: Update overall progress after MCP configuration:

```
CHECKPOINT 3: MCP SETUP AND CONFIGURATION COMPLETE

Update overall progress - MCP setup and configured:

```mermaid

    classDef pending fill:#6b7280,stroke:#4b5563,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
```

Progress: 50% Complete - MCP Configured ✅ - Starting WebSocket Server
```

### Step C.2: Start WebSocket Server

To ensure stability and easy monitoring, run the WebSocket server in the foreground. This dedicates a terminal to the server, confirms it's always running, and saves all logs to a file for later review.

**How to Start and Monitor the Server:**

1.  **Start the Server**: Open a new terminal in your IDE and run the following command. The terminal will become unresponsive, which means the server is running correctly.
    ```bash
    # Runs the server in the foreground and saves all logs to websocket.log
    bun socket > websocket.log 2>&1
    ```

2.  **Monitor Logs**: To see server activity, open a *second* terminal and use this command for a live feed of the logs:
    ```bash
    tail -f websocket.log
    ```
    You can also simply open the `websocket.log` file to view its contents.

3.  **Stop the Server**: To stop the server, go to its dedicated terminal window and press `Ctrl + C`.

**CHECKPOINT C.2**: The server terminal should be active (and unresponsive). You should see a "WebSocket server running on port 3055" message at the beginning of the `websocket.log` file. **Keep the server terminal open.**

### 🔍 Verify WebSocket Server Status

**🚨 CRITICAL FOR AI AGENTS**: Use your IDE's terminal monitoring to verify WebSocket server status:

1. **Check Active Terminals**:
   - Verify you can see the WebSocket server terminal running
   - Confirm the server shows "WebSocket server running on port 3055" message

2. **Verify Server is Active**:
   ```bash
   # In a new terminal (don't close the WebSocket terminal!)
   curl -I http://localhost:3055 2>/dev/null && echo "✅ WebSocket server responding" || echo "❌ Server not responding"

   # Check port status
   lsof -i :3055 && echo "✅ Port 3055 in use by WebSocket server" || echo "❌ Port 3055 not in use"
   ```

3. **Monitor Server Logs**:
   - Keep the WebSocket terminal visible
   - Watch for connection messages when the Figma plugin connects
   - Server logs will show plugin connection status in real-time

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Do NOT close the WebSocket terminal — it must stay running throughout the entire Figma integration session.

**AI AGENTS**: Update progress after WebSocket server start:

```

Progress: 63% Complete - WebSocket Running ✅ - Installing Figma Plugin
```

### Step C.3: Install and Configure Figma Plugin

#### 🔌 Install the Plugin Locally

1. **Register the plugin with Figma**:
   - In Figma Desktop, go to `Plugins` → `Development` → `New Plugin`
   - Choose **"Link existing plugin"**
   - Select the `src/figma_plugin/manifest.json` file from the cloned repository
   - The plugin will now appear in your Figma development plugins

2. **Open Figma and Run the Plugin**:
   - Open any Figma file (or create a new one)
   - Go to `Plugins` menu → `Figma Edit MCP Plugin`
   - The plugin panel will open

#### ⚙️ Configure Plugin to Connect to Local WebSocket

**🚨 CRITICAL**: The plugin needs to connect to your local WebSocket server:

1. **In the Plugin Panel**:
   - Look for **"WebSocket URL"** or **"Server URL"** setting
   - Change the URL from default to: `ws://localhost:3055`
   - Click **"Connect"** or **"Save"** to apply the setting

2. **Verify Connection**:
   - The plugin should show **"Connected"** status
   - You should see a green indicator or success message in the plugin

#### 📡 Monitor Connection Status

**🔍 IMPORTANT FOR AI AGENTS**: Verify the plugin connection via WebSocket server logs:

1. **Check WebSocket Server Logs**:
   - Look at the WebSocket server terminal or `websocket.log`
   - When the plugin connects successfully, you should see log messages like:
     ```
     ✓ Client joined channel "..." (2 total clients)
     ```

2. **Connection Troubleshooting**:
   - If no connection messages appear in server logs, the plugin is not connecting properly
   - Check that WebSocket URL in plugin is set to `ws://localhost:3055`
   - Verify the WebSocket server is still running
   - Try refreshing the Figma page and reconnecting the plugin

**AI AGENTS**: Update progress after Figma plugin installation:

```

Progress: 75% Complete - Plugin Installed ✅ - Running Integration Tests
```

### Step C.4: Test Integration

#### 🧪 Test MCP Commands in Your AI Assistant

**In your AI coding assistant (where MCP is connected):**

```bash
# Test 1: MCP Connection
join_channel
# Expected: "Successfully joined channel" message

# Test 2: Figma Communication
get_document_info
# Expected: JSON data from Figma document
```

#### 📋 Verify Complete Integration

**🔍 FINAL VERIFICATION FOR AI AGENTS**:

1. **Check All Active Processes**:
   - Verify the WebSocket server terminal is still running with "WebSocket server running on port 3055"
   - Verify connection logs showing the Figma plugin is connected
   - Verify the MCP status showing FigmaEdit as connected in your IDE

2. **Test End-to-End Communication**:
   ```bash
   # In your AI assistant, test these MCP commands:
   get_document_info
   get_nodes_info
   ```
   - Commands should return JSON data from your Figma document
   - Check WebSocket server logs — they should show command activity
   - Figma plugin should show activity/response indicators

3. **Integration Status Checklist**:
   - ✅ WebSocket server running (visible in terminal)
   - ✅ Figma plugin connected (connection logs in server terminal)
   - ✅ MCP commands working (returns Figma data)
