### GitHub Copilot in VS Code

1. Requires VS Code 1.102+ with Copilot
2. Enable Agent Mode in Copilot settings
3. Select option `2` (creates `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/mcp.json`)
4. Use `@workspace` or agent mode to access MCP tools

### Google Antigravity

1. Select option `1`
2. Configuration is created at `~/.gemini/antigravity/mcp_config.json`
3. Restart Antigravity to load the MCP server
4. MCP tools are automatically available

### Claude Code (VS Code & CLI)

Select option `5` to see the CLI command, then run it in your terminal:

```bash
claude mcp add FigmaEdit bun run /path/to/figma-edit-mcp/dist/server.js
```

Replace `/path/to/figma-edit-mcp` with your actual installation path.

### Claude Desktop

Select option `4`. Configuration is created at `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`.

---

## Manual Configuration

If you prefer manual setup, add the following to your MCP config file:

| Integration | Config File Location |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` |
| VS Code / Copilot | `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/mcp.json` |
| Antigravity | `~/.gemini/antigravity/mcp_config.json` |
| Claude Desktop | `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |

### Using npm package (recommended for production)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "FigmaEdit": {
      "command": "bunx",
      "args": ["figma-edit-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Using local installation (for development)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "FigmaEdit": {
      "command": "bun",
      "args": ["run", "/path/to/figma-edit-mcp/dist/server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Development Setup

### Building from Source

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Build the MCP server
bun run build

# Watch mode for development
bun run dev
```

### WebSocket Server

Start the WebSocket server (required for Figma plugin communication):

```bash
bun socket
```

### Figma Plugin (Local Install)

1. In Figma, go to Plugins > Development > New Plugin
2. Choose "Link existing plugin"
3. Select the `figma_plugin/manifest.json` file
4. The plugin should now be available in your Figma development plugins

---

## Windows + WSL Guide

1. Install bun via powershell

```bash
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1|iex"
```

2. Uncomment the hostname `0.0.0.0` in `src/socket.ts`

```typescript
// uncomment this to allow connections in windows wsl
hostname: "0.0.0.0",
```

3. Start the websocket

```bash
bun socket
```

---

## Usage

1. Start the WebSocket server
2. Install the MCP server in your AI coding assistant
3. Open Figma and run the Figma Edit MCP Plugin
4. Connect the plugin to the WebSocket server by joining a channel using `join_channel`
5. Use your AI assistant to communicate with Figma using the MCP tools

## Design Automation Examples

**Bulk text content replacement**

Thanks to [@dusskapark](https://github.com/dusskapark) for contributing the bulk text replacement feature. Here is the [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j05gGT3xfCs).

**Instance Override Propagation**
Another contribution from [@dusskapark](https://github.com/dusskapark)
Propagate component instance overrides from a source instance to multiple target instances with a single command. This feature dramatically reduces repetitive design work when working with component instances that need similar customizations. Check out our [demo video](https://youtu.be/uvuT8LByroI).

## Best Practices

When working with the Figma MCP:

1. Always join a channel before sending commands
2. Get document overview using `get_document_info` first
3. Check current selection with `get_selection` before modifications
4. Use appropriate creation tools based on needs:
   - `create_frame` for containers
   - `create_rectangle` for basic shapes
   - `create_text` for text elements
5. Verify changes using `get_node_info`
6. Use component instances when possible for consistency
7. Handle errors appropriately as all commands can throw exceptions
8. For large designs:
   - Use chunking parameters in `scan_text_nodes`
   - Monitor progress through WebSocket updates
   - Implement appropriate error handling
9. For text operations:
   - Use batch operations when possible
   - Consider structural relationships
   - Verify changes with targeted exports
10. For converting legacy annotations:
    - Scan text nodes to identify numbered markers and descriptions
    - Use `scan_nodes_by_types` to find UI elements that annotations refer to
    - Match markers with their target elements using path, name, or proximity
    - Categorize annotations appropriately with `get_annotations`
    - Create native annotations with `set_multiple_annotations` in batches
    - Verify all annotations are properly linked to their targets
    - Delete legacy annotation nodes after successful conversion
11. Visualize prototype noodles as FigJam connectors:
    - Use `get_reactions` to extract prototype flows,
    - set a default connector with `set_default_connector`,
    - and generate connector lines with `create_connections` for clear visual flow mapping.
